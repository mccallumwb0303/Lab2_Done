    <p style="font-size: 17px; color: black;">I am Will McCallum, a computer science major at UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham) with a deep passion for coding, programming, and graphic design. Birmingham, Alabama is where I call home, and it's where I decided to pursue my higher education.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 17px; color: black;">Within the field of computer science, I am driven to constantly learn and improve my skills. Coding, programming, and graphic design have become second nature to me through my experiences and dedicated practice. I find immense satisfaction in bringing ideas to life through technology and design.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 17px; color: black;">Being a part of Alpha Sigma Phi, a prominent fraternity on campus, has provided me with a supportive community and opportunities for personal growth. Collaborating with fellow members and engaging in various activities has further enriched my college experience.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 17px; color: black;">Beyond my academic endeavors, I have actively sought out real-world projects to apply my coding, programming, and graphic design expertise. These experiences have not only expanded my skill set but have also fueled my desire to make a positive impact through technology.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 17px; color: black;">In alignment with the principles outlined in the Auburn Creed, I firmly believe in fostering inclusivity and happiness in every environment I encounter. I am particularly passionate about ensuring accessibility and inclusion for individuals with disabilities. I strive to find innovative ways to bring about positive change and create a more inclusive world.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 17px; color: black;">With a strong foundation in computer science and a creative mindset, I am determined to make meaningful contributions in the realms of technology, design, and beyond.</p>
